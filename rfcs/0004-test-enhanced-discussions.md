# RFC: Test Enhanced Discussion Integration

- Start Date: 2025-01-06
- Target Major Version: (1.x)
- Reference Issues: N/A - Testing workflow
- Implementation PR: (leave this empty)

## Summary

This is a test RFC to verify the enhanced discussion integration workflow. It includes automatic discussion creation with full proposal content and sync capabilities.

## Basic example

```javascript
// This is just test content to verify the workflow
console.log("Enhanced discussion workflow test");
```

## Motivation

We want to ensure that:
1. RFC discussions are created with full proposal content
2. Discussion content is automatically synced when PRs are updated
3. The workflow works correctly with forks
4. Users get a better experience with rich, formatted discussions

## Detailed design

The enhanced workflow includes:

- **Rich Discussion Creation**: Discussions now include the full RFC content, author information, and useful links
- **Automatic Sync**: When RFCs are updated via PR commits, the discussion content automatically updates
- **Better Formatting**: Discussions use proper markdown formatting with sections and metadata
- **Fork Compatibility**: Uses `pull_request_target` to work with fork contributions

### Technical Implementation

1. Enhanced creation workflow extracts RFC content from PR
2. Sync workflow monitors for PR updates and refreshes discussion content
3. GraphQL mutations update existing discussions
4. Proper permissions ensure fork compatibility

## Drawbacks

- Slightly more complex workflow configuration
- Requires GraphQL API usage for discussion updates
- May generate more GitHub API calls

## Alternatives

- Keep the simple discussion format
- Use manual discussion updates
- Rely on PR comments instead of discussions

## Adoption strategy

This is a workflow enhancement that doesn't affect end users directly. RFC authors will benefit from richer discussions automatically.

## Unresolved questions

- Should we add even more metadata to discussions?
- How should we handle very large RFC files?
- Should we include diff information in sync updates?
